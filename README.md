- pointers
  - crd: source of truth is api/v1/helloworld_types.go, the actual k8s crd is in config/crd/bases
  - controller: internal/controller/helloworld_controller.go
  - tests: unimplemented, enumerated scenarios in internal/controller/suite_test.go
- deployment
  - local iteration: `air --build.cmd "make install" --build.bin "make run" --build.exclude_dir api/v1`
  - did not dive into how to deploy to EKS or $insertK8sHost
    - I don't love how Makefiles are necessary for kubebuilder, but... c'est la vie
- dev process
  - choose a local k8s stack (minikube is the one I'd heard of before, so I grabbed that one)
  - figure out how to define a CRD using chatgpt
  - start working through the kubebuilder quickstart, realize that it wanted to bootstrap everything, started over
  - used chatgpt + pkg.go.dev to finish the controller implementation
    - a lot of APIs that i wasn't familiar with (have never written code to interface with k8s internals before)
    - ran into a few hallucinations along the way; finding docs for CRD definitions was surprisingly hard without chatgpt
